This is an example file that can be programmed to the _target device_ on a FRDM_K board to disable the pins associated with the on-chip SWD interface.  
This allows the on-chip SWD interface to be used to program other chips.  
It requires the addition of a 10-pin SWD connector if not already on the board.
